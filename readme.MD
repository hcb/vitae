#Vitae

##What is Vitae?
Vitae is a modern interpretation of Vin Vitae, also know as the Wine of Life, which is a medicinal tonic offered for sale in the 1902 Sears, Roebuck Catalog. Much of the copy on this single page mock-up features text from this ad.

##Getting Started
1. Clone the package from `https://github.com/hcb/vitae`
2. In the `vitae` directory, run `npm install`
3. Run`bower install`
4. With the dependencies in place, run the command `grunt dev`. This will start an Express server and open the project in your browser.

##Trouble?
If my grunt skills have only caused you grief, please check out this [live version of the Vitae landing page](http://cakehat.com/vitae). Please let me know what difficulties you encountered by sending an [email](mailto:hillarycbarth@gmail.com).
